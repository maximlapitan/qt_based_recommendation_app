## Project description

Project aims to predict price of the car based on criteria like mileage, volume of the engine, type of gearbox and so on.

Project uses openly distributed dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/car-price-prediction-challenge).

The dataset itself was modified and normalized, thus we use [our version](car_price_prediction.csv), which is added directly to repository.
